Solve a quadratic equation,  𝑥²+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0 . Write a function which receives  𝑏  and  𝑐 , 
the coefficients of a monic quadratic polynomial,  𝑥²+𝑏𝑥+𝑐 , and returns the pair of its roots. 
The function always returns two values, even if quadratic has a double root.  
For example, given a quadratic  𝑥²−2𝑥+1 , the function returns a pair of  (1,1) . 
Of course, in floating point, the answers may differ from an exact unity.
